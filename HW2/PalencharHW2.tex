\section*{Problem 1}\label{Problem 1}
Show that the cube root of two is irrational.\\
\\
\underline{Proof:} $BWOC$\\
\\
Let one assume that $\sqrt[3]{2} = \frac{a}{b}$ where $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a,b$ 
are co-prime.
One starts by $2 = \frac{a^3}{b^3} \rightarrow 2b^3 = a^3$. At this point one can now say that 
$a = 2k$\\
when rewriting $2b^3= (2k)^3$ as $2b^3 = 8k^3$ one can simplify to $b^3 = 4 k^3$. $\bot$\\
This is a $\bot$ because $b$ is even and $a,b$ are co-prime.

\section*{Problem 2}\label{Problem 2}
Use proof by contrapositive to show that for all integers $a,b$ if both $ab$
and $a+b$ are even then both $a$ and $b$ are even.\\
\\
\underline{Proof:} by contrapositive\\
\\
Suppose that $a$ is an odd number $a = 2k +1$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.\\
$ab = (2k+1)b \Rightarrow 2kb + b$ this expression is odd if $b$ is odd and even if $b$ even.
As for $a+b = 2k + 1 +b$ this expression odd if $b$ is even and even if $b$ is odd. It follows
that if b is even or odd one of the expression will be odd.\\

This argument holds if $b$ is supposed to be is odd.
